# **PBL5 Project - Healthy Heart**

## **Introduction**

- Currently, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world, especially in underdeveloped countries. Many people do not have the opportunity to receive regular check-ups and care for their cardiovascular health because of the high cost and insufficient time. Nowadays, smartphones have become commonplace, and most families own at least one device. Therefore, in this study, we propose a model to warn of abnormal signals in the human heart rhythm as well as proceed to build a practical, convenient, low-cost system for monitoring the heart rate and alerting the user to abnormal signals. This system can measure and give diagnostic results in real time. The model selected in this study is CNN, trained on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database medical dataset with an accuracy of over 90% for the abnormal heart rhythm classification task.
